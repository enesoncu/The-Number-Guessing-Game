# Project Title: The Number Guessing Game

## Description
This Python script challenges you with a fun and engaging number guessing game! Test your intuition and try to guess a hidden number within a limited number of attempts. Can you outsmart the game and win?

## Features
- Interactive gameplay with clear user prompts.
- Immersive ASCII art logo for a touch of game flair (requires art library).
- Randomly generates a secret number between 1 and 100.
- Offers two difficulty levels: Easy (10 attempts) and Hard (5 attempts).
- Provides feedback on your guesses, indicating if they're too high or too low.
- Keeps track of remaining attempts and announces victory or defeat.
- Allows you to play multiple rounds with a user-friendly "play again" prompt.

## How to Play
**1- Run the Script:** Execute the script using **python the_number_guessing_game.py** in your terminal.

**2- Choose Difficulty:** Select "easy" or "hard" to set the number of attempts you'll have.

**3- Start Guessing:** Enter your guess for the hidden number within the range of 1 to 100.

**4- Receive Feedback:** The script will tell you if your guess is too high or too low, guiding you towards the correct answer.

**5- Win or Lose:** If you guess the number correctly within the allowed attempts, you win! Otherwise, the game reveals the secret number and you can try again.

**6- Play Again (Optional):** If you'd like to play another round, type "yes" at the prompt.

## Example Gameplay:
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!

In this game, I'll be thinking of a number between 1 and 100. You'll try to guess!

Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': hard

You have 5 attempts remaining to guess the number.

Make a guess: 75

Too low.

You have 4 attempts remaining to guess the number.

Make a guess: 90

Too high.

You have 3 attempts remaining to guess the number.

Make a guess: 82

Too low.

You have 2 attempts remaining to guess the number.

Make a guess: 87

You got it! The answer was 87.

Do you want to play again? Type 'yes' or 'no': yes
